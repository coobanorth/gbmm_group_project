        <h2>Introduction To Social Media Security</h2>
        <p>Everyday thousands of people have their social media security compromised, this isn’t exclusive to any one group. Accounts from 10 to 10 million followers can be compromised at any time if never protected. 
            This web page will inform you about what risks face social media users, previous data breach-es, and information on day-to-day hacks, and finally how to combat these risks and reduce the chances of having your social media security breached.

                    <p class="p_bald">Social engineering</p>
                    <p>Social engineering is focused mainly on psychology instead of programming. The attacker will try to manipulate the target into revealing sensitive information to gain access to the person's account thought various means such as: pretending to be a friend or colleague, tech support, or other psychological tactics.
                    85% of Instagram users have had their accounts compromised, while 25% of total Facebook accounts have been hijacked.

                    <p>Using weaknesses in the account recovery process, designed to provide those who may have forgotten their password to regain access attackers can gain total control over an account. They do this by obtaining personal information about the target, this can be done in a variety of ways most popular being the already publicly posted information on the account. The most popular are:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Full name – This is often displayed as a username or account name on most pages.</li>
                        <li>Birth date – This is often shown when someone makes a post about their birthday and the age they are turning.</li>
                        <li>Email / Phone number – These aren’t as easy to get hold of but can be displayed in many ways, especially for those who get inquiries for business.</li>
                        <li>Security questions – This can come in many forms most popular being, pet names (very easy when pets are posted online as they often are), place of birth (very easy for those who stay in the same area and most popular locations), mother’s maiden name (not as easy as if your accounts aren’t linked but can also be accessed through last names most famously on Facebook).</li>
                        <li>Address – Once an attacker has a general area all it takes is a house number in the back of a picture or street name and just the sight of the house can cause it to be located.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>From 2021-2022 the number of social media accounts that were hijacked saw an increase of 1,000%.</p>

        <h3>How to protect yourself:</h3>
        <p>However intimidating and big the world of “hacking” is, there’s a plethora of information and options to combat and protect yourself from these attacks such as the following:</p>
        
        <h3>Social engineering</h3><p> - this is more about familiarizing yourself with how things are supposed to operate so you can recognize when it’s not:</p>
        <div class="example_button">
            <button class = "btn" onclick="toggleVisibility('div5')">post and account info</button>
            <div id="div5" class="hidden">
                <img src="../images/social_media/PostAndAccountInfo.png" alt="post and account info">
            </div>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Be careful of requests for personal information and who’s asking for it.</li>
            <li>Verify individuals’ identity before communicating with them.</li>
            <li>Avoid oversharing personal information on social media e.g. full name, location, birth date, email, and phone numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Account recovery</h3><p>This is very similar to social engineering however less contact is used with the user and there-fore can be easier to defend against:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid oversharing personal information on social media e.g. full name, location, birthdate, email, and phone numbers.</li>
            <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all social media, this adds an extra layer of protection so even if someone has your password they cannot access the account without approval.</li>
            <li>Avoid using easily guessable answers to security questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Easily protect yourself now:</h3>
        <p>As you read this you can easily protect yourself by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change your account name to just your first name or even better a nickname.</li>
            <li>Turning on 2-factor authentication.</li>
            <li>Deleting or editing posts containing birthdates, and locations.</li>
            <li>Set your account to private so you can monitor those who have access.</li>
            <li>Change any weak passwords to stronger ones (test on-site above).</li>
        </ul>
