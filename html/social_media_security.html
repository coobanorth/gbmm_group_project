        <h1>Social Media Security</h1>
        <p>Everyday thousands of people have their social media security compromised, this isn’t exclu-sive to any one group. Accounts from 10 to 10 million followers can be compromised at any time if never protected. 
            This webpage will inform you about what risks face social media users, previous data breach-es, and information on day-to-day hacks, and finally how to combat these risks and reduce the chances of having your social media security breached.
        </p>
        <h3><bold>Risks:</bold></h3>
        <p>Most cybercrime is fuelled by 2 main objectives, financial gain and obtaining sensitive infor-mation / tarnishing a person’s identity. There are many ways for someone to obtain your in-formation which we will talk about here. Some of the main ways include:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>
                    <img id="social" src="../images/Social Media/Phishing.png">

                <th>
                    <p><bold>Phishing attacks</bold> - Phishing attacks are some of the most popular due to how easy they are to execute and repli-cate as all it takes is a simple link. Most people will experience this as a random, normally low-followed “bot” account will send a link or an email on a business/school email. Clicking the link sends the user to a malicious website that contains a form of malware, this will either be to sabotage systems in organizations or to trick the user into revealing sensitive information such as passwords.
                    On average 1.4 billion social media accounts are hacked every month, this number will con-tinue to rise as more and more people create social media accounts.
                    </p>

                    <p><bold>Data breaches</bold> - A data breach is the event of an attacker or group of attackers gaining access to a company’s data. Sadly, this is a harsh reality that even the most advanced cyber security systems can be penetrated and exploited, often through employees with social engineering. If the data is pub-lished this isn’t much to do except try to change passwords, emails, and other account securi-ty.
                    In 2018 at least 30 million Facebook accounts were hacked in a single data breach.

                <th>
                    <p><bold>Social engineering</bold> - Social engineering is focused mainly on psychology instead of programming. The attacker will try to manipulate the target into revealing sensitive information to gain access to the person's account thought various means such as: pretending to be a friend or colleague, tech support, or other psychological tactics.
                    85% of Instagram users have had their accounts compromised, while 25% of total Facebook accounts have been hijacked.

                    <p><bold>Brute force attacks</bold> - In a brute force attack the attacker will use automated tools to attempt thousands of possible passwords until the correct one is entered. This method can be very time-consuming but ef-fective if the password is weak.
                    A Google report found that 20% of social media accounts will be compromised at some point.

                    <p><bold>Account recovery</bold> - Using weaknesses in the account recovery process, designed to provide those who may have forgotten their password to regain access attackers can gain total control over an account. They do this by obtaining personal information about the target, this can be done in a variety of ways most popular being the already publicly posted information on the account. The most popular are:</p>

                        <li>Birthdate – This is often shown when someone makes a post about their birthday and the age they are turning.</li>
                        <li>Email / Phone number – These aren’t as easy to get hold of but can be displayed in many ways, especially for those who get inquiries for business.</li>
                        <li>Security questions – This can come in many forms most popular being, pet names (very easy when pets are posted online as they often are), place of birth (very easy for those who stay in the same area and most popular locations), mother’s maiden name (not as easy as if your accounts aren’t linked but can also be accessed through last names most famously on Facebook).</li>
                        <li>Address – Once an attacker has a general area all it takes is a house number in the back of a picture or street name and just the sight of the house can cause it to be lo-cated.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>From 2021-2022 the number of social media accounts that were hijacked saw an increase of 1,000%.</p>

        <h3><bold>How to protect yourself:</bold></h3>
        <p>However intimidating and big the world of “hacking” is, there’s a plethora of information and options to combat and protect yourself from these attacks such as the following:</p>
        <p><bold>Phishing attacks:</bold></p>
        <img src="../images/Social Media/EmailMsgVerify.png">
        <ul>
            <li>Be aware and cautious of suspicious emails, messages, or other means that ask for personal and or login information.</li>
            <li>Always verify the legitimacy of the sender before providing sensitive information.</li>
            <li>Only provide sensitive information to trusted websites, and ensure you check the URL of the site to ensure its legitimate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><bold>Data breaches</bold> - sadly as discussed there isn’t much to prevent it but you can protect your account in the event of a data breach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use strong and unique passwords for each online account so if one site is breached your other accounts aren’t.</li>
            <li>Regularly update your devices, operating systems, and applications to ensure you have the latest security.</li>
            <li>Be careful when granting permissions to third-party apps.</li>
            <li>Adjust privacy settings to make your account private.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><bold>Social engineering</bold> - this is more about familiarizing yourself with how things are supposed to operate so you can recognize when it’s not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be careful of requests for personal information and who’s asking for it.</li>
            <li>Verify individuals’ identity before communicating with them.</li>
            <li>Avoid oversharing personal information on social media e.g. full name, location, birthdate, email, and phone numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><bold>Brute force attacks</bold> - this is quite easy to avoid and defend against with some simple steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use strong passwords with a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters (=@#?).</li>
            <li>Don’t use easily guessable information in your passwords such as names, birthdays, and locations.</li>
            <li>Enable account lockouts, this means the attacker cannot guess the password more than a few times before they are locked out (this should be turned on as standard).</li>
            <li>Consider using a password manager to create and store your passwords.</li>
            <li>You can try out <a href="https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/">this website</a> to see how secure your password is!</li>
        </ul>
        <p><bold>Account recovery</bold> - this is very similar to social engineering however less contact is used with the user and there-fore can be easier to defend against:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid oversharing personal information on social media e.g. full name, location, birthdate, email, and phone numbers.</li>
            <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all social media, this adds an extra layer of protection so even if someone has your password they cannot access the account without approval.</li>
            <li>Avoid using easily guessable answers to security questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><bold>Easily protect yourself now:</bold></p>
        <p>As you read this you can easily protect yourself by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change your account name to just your first name or even better a nickname.</li>
            <li>Turning on 2-factor authentication.</li>
            <li>Deleting or editing posts containing birthdates, and locations.</li>
            <li>Set your account to private so you can monitor those who have access.</li>
            <li>Change any weak passwords to stronger ones (test on-site above).</li>
        </ul>
